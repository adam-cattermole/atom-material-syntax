# dot-gov-syntax

A syntax theme for [Atom Material UI](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-ui). Entirely based on [Atom Material Syntax](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax), but with a different colour palette to work well with the DotGov Iterm 2 colour scheme found here - [iterm2-color-schemes](http://iterm2colorschemes.com/).

I do not claim to have created any of the content in this repository, only to have made adaptions from atom-material-syntax.
